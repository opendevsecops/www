# AWS Scanner Terraform Module

Terraform module which provides easy to configure AWS environment for running automated security scanning solutions at scheduled intervals. You configure it. AWS will run it at minimal cost.

## Getting Started

Getting started is easy. All resources such as the designated ECS cluster, VPCs, and task definitions are provisioned out of the box. Here is a complete example how to setup the Cohesion web security scanner:

```terraform
module "scanner" {
  source = "opendevsecops/scanner/aws"
}

module "scanner_cohesion" {
  source = "opendevsecops/scanner/aws//modules/cohesion"

  schedule = "rate(24 hours)"

  target = "http://target"

  trigger_arn = "${module.scanner.trigger_arn}"
}
```

Scanners outputs are available in the designated CloudWatch groups.

This module is automatically published to the Terraform Module Registry. More information about the available inputs, outputs, dependencies, and instructions on how to use the module can be found at the official page [here](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/opendevsecops/scanner).

## Supported Scanners

The following scanners are currently supported. More scanners can be easily added as long as they are packaged as docker containers:

  * Cohesion - Dynamic Web Application Security Scanner
  * WPScan - Wordpress Security Scanner
  * Nmap - Network Security Scanner
  * GitLeaks - Git Security Scanner
  * Amass - Domain Enumeration
  * Nikto - Web Application Security Scanner

## Contribute

Fork the project. Create a scanner definition in the modules subfolder. Use Cohesion, Nmap or any other scanner as an example. Once you are happy with your changes, create a pull request. We will review and if the submissison is good we will accept it as part of the official module distribution.
